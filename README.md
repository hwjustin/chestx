![image](main_figure.png "MMoE Pipeline")

This repository contains the code implementation of the Multimodal Mixture of Experts (MMoE) strategy for ChestX disease classification task. We apply the MMoE strategy to handle distinct multimodal interactions in the ChestX dataset.

## 1. Setup
**Environment Setup**

```bash
conda env create -f chestx.yml
conda activate chestx
```

**Download ChestXDataset**

```bash
invoke download --dataset chestx
```


## 2. Categorising Multimodal Interactions



## 3. Training Expert Models


## 4. Inference with Mixture of Expert Models
